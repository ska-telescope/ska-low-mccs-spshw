        As the thousands who were dependent upon their daily labor for their
        livelihood mounted into the millions and industries spread across the
        continent, the local unions of craftsmen grew into national craft
        organizations bound together by the newspapers, the telegraph, and the
        railways. Before 1860 there were several such national trade unions,
        including the plumbers, printers, mule spinners, iron molders, and stone
        cutters. All over the North labor leaders arose--men unknown to general
        history but forceful and resourceful characters who forged links binding
        scattered and individual workers into a common brotherhood. An attempt
        was even made in 1834 to federate all the crafts into a permanent
        national organization; but it perished within three years through lack
        of support. Half a century had to elapse before the American Federation
        of Labor was to accomplish this task.

        All the manifestations of the modern labor movement had appeared, in
        germ at least, by the time the mid-century was reached: unions, labor
        leaders, strikes, a labor press, a labor political program, and a labor
        political party. In every great city industrial disputes were a common
        occurrence. The papers recorded about four hundred in two years,
        1853-54, local affairs but forecasting economic struggles in a larger
        field. The labor press seems to have begun with the founding of the
        _Mechanics' Free Press_ in Philadelphia in 1828 and the establishment of
        the New York _Workingman's Advocate_ shortly afterward. These
        semi-political papers were in later years followed by regular trade
        papers designed to weld together and advance the interests of particular
        crafts. Edited by able leaders, these little sheets with limited
        circulation wielded an enormous influence in the ranks of the workers.

        =Labor and Politics.=--As for the political program of labor, the main
        planks were clear and specific: the abolition of imprisonment for debt,
        manhood suffrage in states where property qualifications still
        prevailed, free and universal education, laws protecting the safety and
        health of workers in mills and factories, abolition of lotteries, repeal
        of laws requiring militia service, and free land in the West.

        Into the labor papers and platforms there sometimes crept a note of
        hostility to the masters of industry, a sign of bitterness that excited
        little alarm while cheap land in the West was open to the discontented.
        The Philadelphia workmen, in issuing a call for a local convention,
        invited "all those of our fellow citizens who live by their own labor
        and none other." In Newcastle county, Delaware, the association of
        working people complained in 1830: "The poor have no laws; the laws are
        made by the rich and of course for the rich." Here and there an
        extremist went to the length of advocating an equal division of wealth
        among all the people--the crudest kind of communism.

        Agitation of this character produced in labor circles profound distrust
        of both Whigs and Democrats who talked principally about tariffs and
        banks; it resulted in attempts to found independent labor parties. In
        Philadelphia, Albany, New York City, and New England, labor candidates
        were put up for elections in the early thirties and in a few cases were
        victorious at the polls. "The balance of power has at length got into
        the hands of the working people, where it properly belongs,"
        triumphantly exclaimed the _Mechanics' Free Press_ of Philadelphia in
        1829. But the triumph was illusory. Dissensions appeared in the labor
        ranks. The old party leaders, particularly of Tammany Hall, the
        Democratic party organization in New York City, offered concessions to
        labor in return for votes. Newspapers unsparingly denounced "trade union
        politicians" as "demagogues," "levellers," and "rag, tag, and bobtail";
        and some of them, deeming labor unrest the sour fruit of manhood
        suffrage, suggested disfranchisement as a remedy. Under the influence
        of concessions and attacks the political fever quickly died away, and
        the end of the decade left no remnant of the labor political parties.
        Labor leaders turned to a task which seemed more substantial and
        practical, that of organizing workingmen into craft unions for the
        definite purpose of raising wages and reducing hours.


        THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND NATIONAL POLITICS

        =Southern Plans for Union with the West.=--It was long the design of
        Southern statesmen like Calhoun to hold the West and the South together
        in one political party. The theory on which they based their hope was
        simple. Both sections were agricultural--the producers of raw materials
        and the buyers of manufactured goods. The planters were heavy purchasers
        of Western bacon, pork, mules, and grain. The Mississippi River and its
        tributaries formed the natural channel for the transportation of heavy
        produce southward to the plantations and outward to Europe. Therefore,
        ran their political reasoning, the interests of the two sections were
        one. By standing together in favor of low tariffs, they could buy their
        manufactures cheaply in Europe and pay for them in cotton, tobacco, and
        grain. The union of the two sections under Jackson's management seemed
        perfect.

        =The East Forms Ties with the West.=--Eastern leaders were not blind to
        the ambitions of Southern statesmen. On the contrary, they also
        recognized the importance of forming strong ties with the agrarian West
        and drawing the produce of the Ohio Valley to Philadelphia and New York.
        The canals and railways were the physical signs of this economic union,
        and the results, commercial and political, were soon evident. By the
        middle of the century, Southern economists noted the change, one of
        them, De Bow, lamenting that "the great cities of the North have
        severally penetrated the interior with artificial lines until they have
        taken from the open and untaxed current of the Mississippi the commerce
        produced on its borders." To this writer it was an astounding thing to
        behold "the number of steamers that now descend the upper Mississippi
        River, loaded to the guards with produce, as far as the mouth of the
        Illinois River and then turn up that stream with their cargoes to be
        shipped to New York _via_ Chicago. The Illinois canal has not only swept
        the whole produce along the line of the Illinois River to the East, but
        it is drawing the products of the upper Mississippi through the same
        channel; thus depriving New Orleans and St. Louis of a rich portion of
        their former trade."

        If to any shippers the broad current of the great river sweeping down to
        New Orleans offered easier means of physical communication to the sea
        than the canals and railways, the difference could be overcome by the
        credit which Eastern bankers were able to extend to the grain and
        produce buyers, in the first instance, and through them to the farmers
        on the soil. The acute Southern observer just quoted, De Bow, admitted
        with evident regret, in 1852, that "last autumn, the rich regions of
        Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were flooded with the local bank notes of
        the Eastern States, advanced by the New York houses on produce to be
        shipped by way of the canals in the spring.... These moneyed facilities
        enable the packer, miller, and speculator to hold on to their produce
        until the opening of navigation in the spring and they are no longer
        obliged, as formerly, to hurry off their shipments during the winter by
        the way of New Orleans in order to realize funds by drafts on their
        shipments. The banking facilities at the East are doing as much to draw
        trade from us as the canals and railways which Eastern capital is
        constructing." Thus canals, railways, and financial credit were swiftly
        forging bonds of union between the old home of Jacksonian Democracy in
        the West and the older home of Federalism in the East. The nationalism
        to which Webster paid eloquent tribute became more and more real with
        the passing of time. The self-sufficiency of the pioneer was broken down
        as he began to watch the produce markets of New York and Philadelphia
        where the prices of corn and hogs fixed his earnings for the year.

        =The West and Manufactures.=--In addition to the commercial bonds
        between the East and the West there was growing up a common interest in
        manufactures. As skilled white labor increased in the Ohio Valley, the
        industries springing up in the new cities made Western life more like
        that of the industrial East than like that of the planting South.
        Moreover, the Western states produced some important raw materials for
        American factories, which called for protection against foreign
        competition, notably, wool, hemp, and flax. As the South had little or
        no foreign competition in cotton and tobacco, the East could not offer
        protection for her raw materials in exchange for protection for
        industries. With the West, however, it became possible to establish
        reciprocity in tariffs; that is, for example, to trade a high rate on
        wool for a high rate on textiles or iron.

        =The South Dependent on the North.=--While East and West were drawing
        together, the distinctions between North and South were becoming more
        marked; the latter, having few industries and producing little save raw
        materials, was being forced into the position of a dependent section. As
        a result of the protective tariff, Southern planters were compelled to
        turn more and more to Northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes,
        plows, and machinery. Nearly all the goods which they bought in Europe
        in exchange for their produce came overseas to Northern ports, whence
        transshipments were made by rail and water to Southern points of
        distribution. Their rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were
        not carried to Europe in British bottoms, were transported by Northern
        masters. In these ways, a large part of the financial operations
        connected with the sale of Southern produce and the purchase of goods in
        exchange passed into the hands of Northern merchants and bankers who,
        naturally, made profits from their transactions. Finally, Southern
        planters who wanted to buy more land and more slaves on credit borrowed
        heavily in the North where huge accumulations made the rates of interest
        lower than the smaller banks of the South could afford.

        =The South Reckons the Cost of Economic Dependence.=--As Southern
        dependence upon Northern capital became more and more marked, Southern
        leaders began to chafe at what they regarded as restraints laid upon
        their enterprise. In a word, they came to look upon the planter as a
        tribute-bearer to the manufacturer and financier. "The South,"
        expostulated De Bow, "stands in the attitude of feeding ... a vast
        population of [Northern] merchants, shipowners, capitalists, and others
        who, without claims on her progeny, drink up the life blood of her
        trade.... Where goes the value of our labor but to those who, taking
        advantage of our folly, ship for us, buy for us, sell to us, and, after
        turning our own capital to their profitable account, return laden with
        our money to enjoy their easily earned opulence at home."

        Southern statisticians, not satisfied with generalities, attempted to
        figure out how great was this tribute in dollars and cents. They
        estimated that the planters annually lent to Northern merchants the full
        value of their exports, a hundred millions or more, "to be used in the
        manipulation of foreign imports." They calculated that no less than
        forty millions all told had been paid to shipowners in profits. They
        reckoned that, if the South were to work up her own cotton, she would
        realize from seventy to one hundred millions a year that otherwise went
        North. Finally, to cap the climax, they regretted that planters spent
        some fifteen millions a year pleasure-seeking in the alluring cities and
        summer resorts of the North.

        =Southern Opposition to Northern Policies.=--Proceeding from these
        premises, Southern leaders drew the logical conclusion that the entire
        program of economic measures demanded in the North was without exception
        adverse to Southern interests and, by a similar chain of reasoning,
        injurious to the corn and wheat producers of the West. Cheap labor
        afforded by free immigration, a protective tariff raising prices of
        manufactures for the tiller of the soil, ship subsidies increasing the
        tonnage of carrying trade in Northern hands, internal improvements
        forging new economic bonds between the East and the West, a national
        banking system giving strict national control over the currency as a
        safeguard against paper inflation--all these devices were regarded in
        the South as contrary to the planting interest. They were constantly
        compared with the restrictive measures by which Great Britain more than
        half a century before had sought to bind American interests.

        As oppression justified a war for independence once, statesmen argued,
        so it can justify it again. "It is curious as it is melancholy and
        distressing," came a broad hint from South Carolina, "to see how
        striking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which the
        manufacturing states have reduced the planting states and that which
        formerly bound the Anglo-American colonies to the British empire....
        England said to her American colonies: 'You shall not trade with the
        rest of the world for such manufactures as are produced in the mother
        country.' The manufacturing states say to their Southern colonies: 'You
        shall not trade with the rest of the world for such manufactures as we
        produce.'" The conclusion was inexorable: either the South must control
        the national government and its economic measures, or it must declare,
        as America had done four score years before, its political and economic
        independence. As Northern mills multiplied, as railways spun their
        mighty web over the face of the North, and as accumulated capital rose
        into the hundreds of millions, the conviction of the planters and their
        statesmen deepened into desperation.

        =Efforts to Start Southern Industries Fail.=--A few of them, seeing the
        predominance of the North, made determined efforts to introduce
        manufactures into the South. To the leaders who were averse to secession
        and nullification this seemed the only remedy for the growing disparity
        in the power of the two sections. Societies for the encouragement of
        mechanical industries were formed, the investment of capital was sought,
        and indeed a few mills were built on Southern soil. The results were
        meager. The natural resources, coal and water power, were abundant; but
        the enterprise for direction and the skilled labor were wanting. The
        stream of European immigration flowed North and West, not South. The
        Irish or German laborer, even if he finally made his home in a city, had
        before him, while in the North, the alternative of a homestead on
        Western land. To him slavery was a strange, if not a repelling,
        institution. He did not take to it kindly nor care to fix his home where
        it flourished. While slavery lasted, the economy of the South was
        inevitably agricultural. While agriculture predominated, leadership with
        equal necessity fell to the planting interest. While the planting
        interest ruled, political opposition to Northern economy was destined to
        grow in strength.

        =The Southern Theory of Sectionalism.=--In the opinion of the statesmen
        who frankly represented the planting interest, the industrial system was
        its deadly enemy. Their entire philosophy of American politics was
        summed up in a single paragraph by McDuffie, a spokesman for South
        Carolina: "Owing to the federative character of our government, the
        great geographical extent of our territory, and the diversity of the
        pursuits of our citizens in different parts of the union, it has so
        happened that two great interests have sprung up, standing directly
        opposed to each other. One of these consists of those manufactures which
        the Northern and Middle states are capable of producing but which, owing
        to the high price of labor and the high profits of capital in those
        states, cannot hold competition with foreign manufactures without the
        aid of bounties, directly or indirectly given, either by the general
        government or by the state governments. The other of these interests
        consists of the great agricultural staples of the Southern states which
        can find a market only in foreign countries and which can be
        advantageously sold only in exchange for foreign manufactures which come
        in competition with those of the Northern and Middle states.... These
        interests then stand diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to each
        other. The interest, the pecuniary interest of the Northern
        manufacturer, is directly promoted by every increase of the taxes
        imposed upon Southern commerce; and it is unnecessary to add that the
        interest of the Southern planter is promoted by every diminution of
        taxes imposed upon the productions of their industry. If, under these
        circumstances, the manufacturers were clothed with the power of imposing
        taxes, at their pleasure, upon the foreign imports of the planter, no
        doubt would exist in the mind of any man that it would have all the
        characteristics of an absolute and unqualified despotism." The economic
        soundness of this reasoning, a subject of interesting speculation for
        the economist, is of little concern to the historian. The historical
        point is that this opinion was widely held in the South and with the
        progress of time became the prevailing doctrine of the planting
        statesmen.

        Their antagonism was deepened because they also became convinced, on
        what grounds it is not necessary to inquire, that the leaders of the
        industrial interest thus opposed to planting formed a consolidated
        "aristocracy of wealth," bent upon the pursuit and attainment of
        political power at Washington. "By the aid of various associated
        interests," continued McDuffie, "the manufacturing capitalists have
        obtained a complete and permanent control over the legislation of
        Congress on this subject [the tariff].... Men confederated together upon
        selfish and interested principles, whether in pursuit of the offices or
        the bounties of the government, are ever more active and vigilant than
        the great majority who act from disinterested and patriotic impulses.
        Have we not witnessed it on this floor, sir? Who ever knew the tariff
        men to divide on any question affecting their confederated interests?...
        The watchword is, stick together, right or wrong upon every question
        affecting the common cause. Such, sir, is the concert and vigilance and
        such the combinations by which the manufacturing party, acting upon the
        interests of some and the prejudices of others, have obtained a decided
        and permanent control over public opinion in all the tariff states."
        Thus, as the Southern statesman would have it, the North, in matters
        affecting national policies, was ruled by a "confederated interest"
        which menaced the planting interest. As the former grew in magnitude and
        attached to itself the free farmers of the West through channels of
        trade and credit, it followed as night the day that in time the planters
        would be overshadowed and at length overborne in the struggle of giants.
        Whether the theory was sound or not, Southern statesmen believed it and
