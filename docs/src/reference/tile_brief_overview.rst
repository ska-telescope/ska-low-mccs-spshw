 MccsTile general overview
##########################

This page gives a general brief overview to the architecture of the MccsTile.

********************************
 Tango Tile Device Construction
********************************

During deployment MccsTile is constructed with a platform specific configuration defined by helm see https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-low-mccs-spshw/en/latest/guide/deploy.html.
The MccsTile contructs a TileComponentManager using information from this configuration. 
This configuration includes a simulation_mode flag. When simulation_mode is TRUE a TileSimulator 
will be constructed and used as the backend, when False a ska_low_sps_tpm_api.Tile object will be created to 
interface with the hardware as a backend.

Tile brief architecture
=======================
The MccsTile inherits from the SkaTangoBase class, this is the interface for TANGO control.
Information and instructions are sent to the hardware using this interface via a 'TileComponentManager'. 
The 'TileComponentManager' is a 'PollingComponentManager' and will poll requests on the backend system, 
the decision of what to poll is determined by the 'TileRequestProvider'. 

.. uml:: tile_class_diagram_brief.uml

Tile On sequence
================
The "On" command will bring the MccsTile to 'PowerState.ON https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-control-model/en/latest/power_state.html
This will involve sending the On command to the MccsSubrack to deliver power then executing the initialise
command to the TPM as soon as it is connectable. If a global reference time has been specified, the 
acquistion is also started, using the specified time as a reference for the internal
timestamp registers. 

.. uml:: tile_on.uml

For more information about how the Tile On command fits into the power sequence 
see https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-low-mccs-spshw/en/latest/reference/power.html

Tile operation state
====================
See https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-control-model/en/stable/op_state.html.

Information specific to Tile is provided below:

-  UNKNOWN: the control system is monitoring (or at least trying to monitor) the system under control, but is unable to determine its state.
   this will occur when we cannot connect with the TPM and the MccsSubrack is reporting its ports power UNKNOWN.

-  OFF: the control system is monitoring the system under control, which is powered off. This will occur when MccsSubrack says the port
   is NO_SUPPLY or OFF, and we are NOT connected with the TPM.

-  STANDBY: Not implemented in Tile.

-  ON: The control system is monitoring the system under control, which is turned on.
   This will occur when we are connected and communicating with the TPM.

-  FAULT: The Tile will be in state FAULT under inconsistent state. Currently if we can connect with the TPM but the MccsSubrack is reporting 
   a inconsistent state (i.e not ON), we are in FAULT state.

Tile provides a more detailed state in the attribute 'tileProgrammingState'. This may take the values:

-  Unknown: the TPM is in UNKNOWN power state 

-  Off: the TPM is in OFF power state

-  Unconnected: the subrack is providing power to the TPM but no connection has been established

-  NotProgrammed: The TPM is connected but the FPGAs have not been programmed

-  Programmed: The TPM is programmed but not initialised

-  Initialised: The TPM has been initialised, the internal PPS is aligned but acquisition has not been started. 

-  Synchronised: The TPM has been initialised and the data stream has been started and synchronised. Internal timestamps are valid. 

The TPM must be in Synchronised state to be usable for observations. All these steps are automatically executed when turning 
on a tile, as part of the `On()` command, or in the `Initialise()` command. The last step (synchronisation) is 
executed automatically if a global reference time, needed for synchronisation, has been specified, otherwise it has to be
executed separately with the command `StartAcquisition()`

Synchronization Procedure
=========================
The main timing reference for the TPM is the 10 MHz clock. This is used to generate a system clock at 100 MHz, which in turn generates a 
200 MHz processing clock and a 800 MHz sampling clock.

The PPS signal is resampled at 100 MHz and in turn this is used to correctly label samples from the ADC. 
The PPS signal must be stable enough to correctly identify the 100 MHz transition which is used internally as a PPS edge. 
The MccsTile attribute `ppsDelayCorrection` is used to internally shift the PPS signal, in units of 1.25 ns, in order to avoid 
metastability problems and to unambiguously define the 100 MHz transition with a "reasonable" relative jitter
between the two signals. This delay can be slightly adjusted by the PPS synchronisation hardware, with the 
actual value returned in the `ppsDelay` attribute. At each active edge, the alignment of the internal 
PPS is checked, to detect cycle jumps. 

The 100 MHz clock is used to generate an internal version of the PPS, and tis is counted in a second counter. 
The external PPS is used to synchronise this internal signal, during TPM initialisation. The second counter is
initialised to the current Unix time, during initialisation, and is available as the `fpgaTime` attribute. 
Leap seconds are not yet managed by the software. As this synchronisation is rather simple, it can be managed 
by software. The MccsTile device wites the current Unix time in the hardware counter around the center of a 
second. Unix time is determined by NTP, with respect to the telescope NTP server. 

During initialisation the ADC links are synchronised and aligned, and generate a continuous stream of samples,
aligned with the internal clock. Data processing is not started. Internal high accuracy timing is determined 
by conuting samples, or group of samples (frames), from a specific Unix time (reference time). This time must
be the same for all TPMs in the telescope, and is given by the `globalReferenceTime` attribute. 
The `StartAcquisition` method is used to start the actual signal processing chain, at a specific Unix time
(in the future), using the `globalReferenceTime` (in the past) specified in the attribute 
or as a command parameter. 

In short, there are two ways to synchronise a tile

-  (preferred): Specify the desired reference time in the `globalReferenceTime` attribute, and initialise
   the TPM by turning it On or with the Initialise command. 

-  Initialise the TPM and then start the acquisition using the StartAcquisition command. This must
   specify a common reference time 

Frames are composed of 864 ADC samples, starting at `globalReferenceTime`, and corresponding to one
channelised sample (1.08 microseconds sampling period). All internal commands to the TPM are
specified at hardware level in units of 256 frames (276.48 microseconds). These units are used also to
timestamp SPEAD packets to the DAQ system, and is indicated in the software/firmware as a `timestamp`. 
As the frame period does not divide exactly one second, 
the StartAcquisition command does not start the acquisition at a second boundary, but at the 
correct time to align frames with the common (virtual) frame phase. 

SPEAD packets to CBF contain 2048 channelised samples (2.21184 ms). The number of packets between 
TAI 2000 epoch and the `globalReferenceTime` is added to the packet counter in the SPEAD 
header to mark the start time of the packet. Representing time using an integer
number of packets imposes that the `globalReferenceTime` must
be at a multiple of 864 seconds since TAI 2000. This is enforced in the software, and the 
attribute value is corrected to represent the actual used value. Another important
limitation si due to the fact that the timestamp counter is currently sized at 32 bits, limiting
the maximum representable time at 13.74 days after the `globalReferenceTime`. This 
implies that the TPMS must be reinitialised and synchronised at most every 13 days. 


Firmware Thresholds â€“ Engineering Mode Command
==============================================

Overview
--------

Firmware thresholds are **EngineeringMode-only** commands used to configure and validate 
firmware-level safety and operational limits for voltage, current, and temperature.

The following attributes are available:

- ``firmwareVoltageThresholds``
- ``firmwareCurrentThresholds``
- ``firmwareTemperatureThresholds``

These attributes represent the threshold values read directly from the firmware and 
become available **after connecting to the TPM** (Tile Processing Module).

Behavior and Lifecycle
----------------------

When interacting with firmware thresholds, the following operational flow applies:

1. **Writing a Threshold**

   When a threshold is written:

   - The value is first written to the **firmware**.
   - If the firmware write succeeds, the **database (DB)** is updated to reflect 
     the desired value.
   - An automatic **comparison** between the DB and firmware values is then performed.

2. **Fault Detection**

   If any mismatch between the DB and firmware values is detected, the device will 
   enter a **fault state**. The fault state ensures that configuration discrepancies 
   between stored expectations and actual firmware conditions are highlighted immediately.

Diagnosing Configuration Faults
-------------------------------

The ``faultreport`` attribute provides detailed diagnostic information for configuration 
mismatches. A typical fault report looks like this:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "firmware_configuration_status": 
     "Configuration mismatch: [voltages.MGT_AVCC_min_alarm_threshold] DB=0.829, HW=0.828; 
      [voltages.MGT_AVCC_max_alarm_threshold] DB=0.944, HW=0.945; 
      [voltages.MGT_AVTT_min_alarm_threshold] DB=1.105, HW=1.104; 
      [voltages.MGT_AVTT_max_alarm_threshold] DB=1.25, HW=1.26"
   }

This example indicates that the database (DB) and hardware (HW) values are not identical, 
resulting in a firmware configuration fault.

Clearing Configuration Faults
-----------------------------

If you wish to **clear the database values** without performing a write to firmware, 
you can set the desired thresholds to ``"Undefined"``. This is a special keyword that 
instructs the system **not to compare** firmware values for these entries.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   tile.firmwareVoltageThresholds = json.dumps({
       "MGT_AVCC_min_alarm_threshold": "Undefined",
       "MGT_AVCC_max_alarm_threshold": "Undefined",
       "MGT_AVTT_min_alarm_threshold": "Undefined",
       "MGT_AVTT_max_alarm_threshold": "Undefined"
   })

After applying this, any mismatch faults related to these thresholds will be cleared.

Persistence and Power Cycle Behavior
------------------------------------

- **Database Persistence**

  The database values are **persisted** and **restored on startup**. A pod bounce or 
  device restart will not alter previously written threshold values.

- **Firmware Reset on Power Cycle**

  A **power cycle** resets all firmware thresholds to **default BIOS-defined values**.  
  If the database contains overridden thresholds, this will result in a 
  **configuration mismatch fault** upon reconnect.

  To resolve this:

  - Reapply the desired threshold overrides, **or**
  - Set the thresholds to ``"Undefined"`` to prevent comparison until the configuration is updated.
