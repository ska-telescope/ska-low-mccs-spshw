      A platform configuration specification for the AAVS3,
      as currently configured whilst temporarily located in the Low ITF.

      For file structure details, see
      https://confluence.skatelescope.org/display/SE/MCCS-1628%3A+platform+configuration+specification+file+for+MCCS+deployment.
      Note in particular that this structure requires string keys for stations, subracks, tpms, etc,
      but the *convention* currently in use simply numbers them off.
      Hence these keys are strings such as "1", rather than the integer 1.
