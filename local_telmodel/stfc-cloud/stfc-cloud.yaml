      Telmodel data for a minikube deployment.

      This data assumes that the telescope software is being deployed
      to a minikube environment on a development machine, and as such,
      this platforn does not have access to any telescope hardware.

      Minikube-based development platforms with access to telescope hardware
      might choose to start from this telmodel data,
      and describe their telescope hardward in a separate telmodel source.
