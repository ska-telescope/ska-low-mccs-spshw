This module provides a simulated component manager for the PaSD bus.

The components of a PaSD system all share the same multi-drop serial
bus, and monitoring and control of those component is necessarily via
that bus:

* MccsAntenna instances use the bus to monitor and control their
  antennas;
* MccsSmartbox instances use the bus to monitor and control their
  smartboxes;
* The MccsFndh instance uses the bus to monitor and control the FNDH

To arbitrate access and prevent collisions/congestion, the MccsPasdBus
device is given exclusive use of the PaSD bus. All other devices can
only communicate on the PaSD bus by proxying through MccsPasdBus.

To that end, MccsPasdBus needs a PasdBusComponentManager that talks to
the PaSD bus using MODBUS-over-TCP. This class is not yet written; but
meanwhile, the PasdBusSimulatorComponentManager takes its place,
pretends to provide access to the PaSD bus, but instead of talking
MODBUS-over-TCP to a real PaSD bus, it talks pure-python to a stub
PaSD bus simulator instance.

The Pasd bus simulator class is provided below. To help manage
complexity, it is composed of a separate FNDH simulator and a number of
smartbox simulators, which in turn make use of port simulators. Only the
PasdBusSimulator class should be considered public.

class _PasdPortSimulator:
    """
    A private class that manages a single simulated port of a PaSD device.

    It supports:

    * breaker tripping: in the real hardware, a port breaker might trip,
      for example as a result of an overcurrent condition. This
      simulator provides for simulating a breaker trip. Once tripped,
      the port will not deliver any power until the breaker has been
      reset.

    * local forcing: a technician in the field can manually force the
      power state of a port. If forced off, a port will not deliver
      power regardless of other settings. If forced on, an (untripped)
      port will deliver power regardless of other settings.

    * online and offline delivery of power. When we tell a port to turn
      on, we can also indicate whether we want it to remain on if the
      control system goes offline. This simulator remembers that
      information, but there's no way to tell the simulator that the
      control system is offline because the whole point of these
      simulators is to simulate the PaSD from the point of view of the
      control system. By definition, the control system cannot observe
      the behaviour of PaSD when the control system is offline, so there
      is no need to implement this behaviour.
