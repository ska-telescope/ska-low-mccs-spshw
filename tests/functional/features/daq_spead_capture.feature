      """This module contains the features and scenarios for the daq SPEAD capture test."""

Feature: Receiving SPEAD packets.
  As a MCCS developer i want to ensure DAQ is capable of capturing SPEAD data.

  # Acceptance Criteria:
  #  - I will be able to configure the DAQ to listen on a specific port interface.
  #  - I will be able to start DAQ for capturing data.
  #  - I can send simulated SPEAD data to a specific IP:PORT
  #  - Daq will receive these packets.

  # Notes:
  # - This test is skipped if not a true context

  @XTP-34316
  Scenario Outline: Sending SPEAD packets to be captured by DAQ
    Given this test is running against station <expected_station>.
    And the DAQ is available
    And the DAQ has no consumers running
    And the Tile is available
    And the Subrack is available
    And DAQ is ready to receive <daq_modes_of_interest> data type.
    And MccsTile is routed to daq
    When MccsTile sends <data_type> data type
    Then Daq receives data <daq_modes_of_interest>

    Examples: modes of interest
      | daq_modes_of_interest   | data_type | no_of_tiles | expected_station |
      | INTEGRATED_CHANNEL_DATA | channel   | 16          | real-daq-1       |
      | CHANNEL_DATA            | channel   | 16          | ral-software     |
