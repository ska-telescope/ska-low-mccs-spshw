Feature: Daq Status Reporting
    As a developer,
    I want the MccsDaqReceiver to report its status,
    So that we know what state it is in.

    # TODO: These healthstate tests don't make sense as functional tests since we can't set the fault bit on demand.
    # # Maybe port them to be integration tests or something if it has value.
    # @forked
    # Scenario Outline: HealthState Transitions
    #     Given an MccsDaqReceiver
    #     And MccsDaqReceiver AdminMode is set to 'ONLINE'
    #     And the MccsDaqReceiver HealthState is <initial_health_state>
    #     When <method> is called
    #     Then the MccsDaqReceiver HealthState is <final_health_state>

    #     Examples: tbl_healthstate
    #         |   initial_fault_state |   initial_health_state    |   method                  |   final_health_state  |
    #         |   'not_set'           |   'OK'                    |   'set_fault_bit'         |   'FAILED'            |
    #         |   'set'               |   'FAILED'                |   'unset_fault_bit'       |   'OK'                |

    Scenario Outline: Consumers Starting Up
        Given this test is running against station_cluster <station_name>
        And an MccsDaqReceiver
        And MccsDaqReceiver AdminMode is set to 'ONLINE'
        And no consumers are running
        When <consumer> is started
        Then consumer_status attribute shows <consumer> as running

        Examples: tbl_consumers_up
            | consumer                  | station_name |
            | 'RAW_DATA'                | ci-1         |
            | 'CHANNEL_DATA'            | ci-1         |
            | 'BEAM_DATA'               | ci-1         |
            | 'CONTINUOUS_CHANNEL_DATA' | ci-1         |
            | 'INTEGRATED_BEAM_DATA'    | ci-1         |
            | 'STATION_BEAM_DATA'       | ci-1         |
            | 'CORRELATOR_DATA'         | ci-1         |
            | 'ANTENNA_BUFFER'          | ci-1         |
            | 'RAW_DATA'                | real-daq-1   |
            | 'CHANNEL_DATA'            | real-daq-1   |
            | 'BEAM_DATA'               | real-daq-1   |
            | 'CONTINUOUS_CHANNEL_DATA' | real-daq-1   |
            | 'INTEGRATED_BEAM_DATA'    | real-daq-1   |
            | 'STATION_BEAM_DATA'       | real-daq-1   |
            #        |   'CORRELATOR_DATA'           |            real-daq-1         | # bug MCCS-1810 and needs GPU.
            | 'ANTENNA_BUFFER'          | real-daq-1   |

    Scenario: Consumers Stopping
        Given this test is running against station_cluster ci-1
        And an MccsDaqReceiver
        And MccsDaqReceiver AdminMode is set to 'ONLINE'
        And all consumers are running
        When 'stop_daq' is called
        Then consumer_status attribute shows no consumers are running

    @forked
    Scenario Outline: Report Status
        Given this test is running against station_cluster ci-1
        And an MccsDaqReceiver
        And the MccsDaqReceiver has a particular <configuration>
        When 'daq_status' is called
        Then it returns the <expected_status>

        Examples: config_status
            | configuration     | expected_status     |
            | 'configuration_1' | 'expected_status_1' |
            | 'configuration_2' | 'expected_status_2' |
